# Database Engineer Capstone

In this project, I made use of my data engineering skills to build a data infrastructure for Little Lemon.

## Data Model and ER diagram

The entity relationship (ER) diagram created can be found [here](littlelemondb.png) while the SQL file that was generated using MySQL forward engineer feature and used to create the database and the tables it contains is accessible [here](littlelemondb.sql)

## Stored Procedures

The procedures created to add, update, delete, and manage bookings can be found in [procedures.sql](procedures.sql). This file also contains the `AddValidBooking()` and `GetMaxQuantity()` procedures and all other SQL code written while completing the weekly tasks.

## Data Analytics

The Tableau workbook created to visualize Little Lemon sales and profits data in the United States and draw insights that can help drive business decisions can be found in the [Little Lemon Sales and Profits.twbx](Little Lemon Sales and Profits.twbx)

## Database Client

The database client created using MYSQL Connector/Python can be found in this [Jupyter notebook](capstone-db-client.ipynb)
